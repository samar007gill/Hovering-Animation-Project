# Hovering Animation Project ✨🎨

Welcome to the **Hovering Animation Project**! This project creates a stunning hovering animation effect using custom HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. When you hover over a card, a shimmering pixel animation appears and fades away, creating a visually engaging effect. ✨💡

## Project Structure 📁

- **index.html**: The main HTML file that holds the structure and content of the page.
- **styles.css**: Contains the CSS styles, including layout, colors, animations, and design. 🎨
- **script.js**: The JavaScript file that controls the behavior of the pixel animation. ⚙️

## Features 🚀

- **Pixel Animation**: When you hover or focus on a card, a pixelated animation is triggered inside each card. 🌟
- **Customizable Speed and Colors**: You can customize the speed and colors of the pixel animation via HTML attributes. 🎨⚡
- **Responsive Design**: The layout automatically adjusts to different screen sizes for a smooth user experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop. 📱💻

## How to Use 🛠️

### 1. Clone the repository
To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hovering-animation.git
```

### 2. Open the files
Open the `index.html` file in your browser to see the animation in action. 🌐✨

### 3. Customize
You can modify the colors and speed of the pixel animation by editing the `data-` attributes in the HTML for each `<pixel-canvas>` element.

For example:
```html
<pixel-canvas data-gap="5" data-speed="50" data-colors="#ff0000, #00ff00, #0000ff"></pixel-canvas>
```
- `data-gap`: Controls the gap between each pixel. 🟩🟦
- `data-speed`: Controls the speed of the pixel animation. ⚡
- `data-colors`: A comma-separated list of colors that the pixels will change between. 🎨

## How it Works 🔍

### HTML (index.html)
- The structure is based on a series of cards. Each card contains a `<pixel-canvas>` element where the animation occurs.
- The SVG icons and buttons in the cards are styled and animated on hover. 🖼️✨

### CSS (styles.css)
- The CSS defines a dark theme with light text, giving the hover animation a dramatic look. 🌚✨
- **Grid Layout**: The cards are laid out using CSS Grid. The layout adapts to different screen sizes. 📐
- **Hover Effects**: Each card has hover effects that change the border color and reveal the pixel animation. 🖱️💥

### JavaScript (script.js)
- **Pixel Class**: The `Pixel` class is responsible for drawing each pixel on the canvas. It randomly generates the size and speed of each pixel's animation. 🎮
- **PixelCanvas Class**: This custom element controls the canvas size, pixel creation, and animation. It listens for hover and focus events to trigger the animation. 🖥️✨

## Example Cards 🃏

Here are some sample cards that show different color themes for the animation:

```html
<div class="card" style="--active-color: #e0f2fe">
    <pixel-canvas data-gap="10" data-speed="25" data-colors="#e0f2fe, #7dd3fc, #0ea5e9"></pixel-canvas>
    <svg>...</svg>
    <button>Code</button>
</div>
```

- **Card 1**: A soft blue color scheme. 💙
- **Card 2**: A yellow-orange theme. 🟨🟧
- **Card 3**: A vibrant pink color palette. 💗
